## Design System

### Color Scheme

The color system has been completely revamped with a Linear.app-inspired palette:

- **Primary Colors**: Rich blue primary color with a complete scale (50-950) for consistent UI elements
- **Semantic Colors**: Added success, warning, and info states for clear status indication
- **Dark Mode**: Refined dark mode palette for better contrast and readability
- **Gradient Text**: Created utilities for gradient text on headings and important elements

```css
/* Primary color example */
--primary: 224 76% 48%;
--primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
--primary-50: 224 100% 98%;
--primary-100: 224 95% 94%;
/* ... through to 950 */
```

### Typography

Typography has been enhanced for better readability and visual hierarchy:

- **Font Hierarchy**: Proper heading styles and weights for clear content structure
- **Font Features**: Added font-feature-settings for better text rendering and legibility
- **Text Styles**: Created utility classes for different text styles (lead, small, etc.)
- **Line Heights**: Implemented proper line heights and letter spacing for improved readability

```css
/* Typography example */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  @apply font-display tracking-tight;
}

h1 {
  @apply text-4xl font-bold md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl;
}
```

### Spacing and Layout

Consistent spacing system for better visual rhythm:

- **Grid System**: Implemented a flexible grid system with responsive breakpoints

### 3D Effects

- **3D Cards**: Implemented perspective effects with mouse tracking
- **Depth Perception**: Created layered elements with parallax effects
- **Transform Utilities**: Added utility functions for 3D transformations

```jsx
// Example of 3D card usage
<Card
  is3D={true}
  depth={1.5}
  variant="gradient"
  className="my-card"
>
  <CardContent>
    Card with 3D effect
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

## Layout System

New layout components for consistent spacing and structure:

### Container Components

- **Container**: Centered content with max-width constraints
- **Section**: Full-width sections with consistent padding
- **Grid**: Flexible grid layouts with responsive columns
- **Flex**: Flexible box layouts with various alignment options

### Utility Components

- **Spacer**: Consistent spacing between elements
- **Divider**: Horizontal and vertical dividers
- **AspectRatio**: Maintain consistent aspect ratios for media

```jsx
// Example of layout components
<Section background="muted" paddingY="lg">
  <Container maxWidth="xl">
    <Grid cols={{ default: 1, md: 2, lg: 3 }} gap="lg">
      {/* Grid items */}
    </Grid>
  </Container>
</Section>
```

## Component Enhancements

### Button Component

Enhanced with modern styling and interactive elements:

- **Multiple Variants**: Added gradient, glass, and semantic color variants
- **Animated Hover**: Implemented subtle scaling and shimmer effects
- **Loading States**: Added spinner animation for loading state
- **Icon Support**: Support for icons on either side of text
- **Elevation Options**: Different shadow styles for visual hierarchy

```jsx
// Example of enhanced button
<Button
  variant="gradient"
  size="lg"
  rightIcon={<ArrowRight />}
  elevation="glow"
>
  Get Started
</Button>
```

### Card Component

Sophisticated card component with 3D effects:

- **3D Perspective**: Added mouse tracking for interactive depth perception
- **Multiple Variants**: Glass and gradient styles for visual variety
- **Hover Animations**: Lift, scale, and glow effects on hover
- **Animated Sections**: Staggered entrances for card content sections

```jsx
// Example of enhanced card
<Card
  variant="glass"
  hover="lift"
  elevation="md"
  is3D={true}
>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card description text</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    Main content goes here

  gap={{ default: "gap-4", lg: "gap-8" }}
>
  <ResponsiveText
    size={{ default: "text-base", lg: "text-lg" }}
    align={{ default: "left", sm: "center" }}

## Usage Guidelines

### Animation Best Practices

- Use animations purposefully to enhance user experience, not distract
- Keep animations subtle and natural for professional applications
- Consider performance implications, especially on mobile devices
- Use staggered animations for related elements to create visual flow

### Responsive Design Guidelines

- Always test designs across multiple device sizes
- Use the responsive components to handle layout changes
- Consider touch interactions for mobile users
- Ensure text remains readable at all screen sizes

### Accessibility Considerations

- Animations respect user preferences via `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Interactive elements have appropriate focus states
- Semantic HTML is used throughout components
