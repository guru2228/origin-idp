Generate a report for leadership team about the current status of Intelligent Data Pipelines using Microsoft Fabric. Based on last week's offsite, i observed that the Intelligent Data Pipelines engineering team has only completed Proof of Concept and whatever the pipelines that they have built are so far not reusable as the team has not generalized all steps or activities (source, validate, pre-transform, transform, post transform, async process, sink) with appropriate metadata, so it can be highly configurable, reusable and easily adoptable by all federated teams and eventually the metadata is the key component to enable intelligence in the Data Pipelines via RAG and LLM Agents and to activate the data to trigger clinical workflows. but callout that the team has gained significant knowledge on Microsoft Fabric in the last 4 months from Jan to April 2025 and significantly worked with Chief Data Office team to resolve all road blocks to implement and adopt Microsoft Fabric in Optum Health. Also the DataOps console Web App is not yet built part of Intelligent Data Pipelines. Attached screenshot contains the plan that i have produced out of the IDP offsite last week.
