# Modern UI Design Research

## Linear.app Design Principles

### Key Design Elements
- **Reduced Visual Noise**: Adjusted sidebar, tabs, headers, and panels to reduce visual noise
- **Visual Alignment**: Maintained consistent alignment of UI elements
- **Increased Hierarchy**: Enhanced the hierarchy and density of navigation elements
- **Inverted L-Shape Layout**: Focus on the global chrome of the application that controls content in the main view
- **Cohesive, Timeless UI**: Design that evolves with the product rather than following temporary trends
- **Meticulous Attention to Detail**: Even the smallest details are carefully considered
- **Purpose-Built System**: Designed specifically for product development workflows

### Color System
- Uses LCH color space instead of HSL for more perceptually uniform colors
- Dark mode with subtle color accents
- Consistent color application across the interface
- Careful use of opacity and elevation to create visual hierarchy

### Typography and Layout
- Clean, readable typography with clear hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Grid-based layout system
- Careful balance between density and breathing room

## 2025 UI Design Trends

### 1. Big Typography
- Oversized, bold text as the main visual element
- Large, bold fonts dominate the composition
- Grabs attention and enhances readability
- Often paired with clean, minimal layouts
- Examples: Heart Aerospace, Allta

### 2. Brutalism
- Bold, large typography and monochromatic color schemes
- Raw, undecorated aesthetic
- Rigid, grid-like structure for clarity
- Avoids unnecessary decoration
- Examples: Northeast, Mouthwash

### 3. Morphism
- Blends sharp focus with smooth gentle blur transitions
- Creates a modern, fluid feel
- Enhances interface depth and interaction
- Makes interfaces more intuitive and visually engaging

### 4. Other Notable Trends
- AI-integrated design
- Cross-platform UX
- 3D visual elements
- Animated micro-interactions
- Minimalism with purpose
- Immersive experiences
- Designs that connect with users
